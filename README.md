# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project aims to solve a classification problem. The classification problem is that of handwritten digits. To solve this problem, we test the data on multiple classifiers and then implement an ensemble classifier using bagging and majority voting. Performance of all the classifiers is evaluated individually and compared with the ensemble classifier. We take the MNIST public dataset and train and test on it. The classifiers used to solve the problem are Logistic Regression using backpropagation, Support Vector Machine, Neural networks and Random Forest Classifiers.
